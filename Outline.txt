Project 2
By Blessing, Josh, and Matt.

MacOverflow (name pending)

Tenatively, a message board type app geared towards students and educators.
Different topics correspond to different 'rooms' and users can input questions for other users to answer a la stackoverflow or yahoo answers.
Database will be used to store questions and user data as well as for authentication of administrators.
All CRUD operations will be viable(making a post, editing a post, deleting your post, seeing other users questions)
Authentication will be done serverside via administrator accounts and checking user-id against data saved to the questions.

# Project 2
# By Blessing, Josh, and Matt.

# MacOverflow (name pending)

Tenatively, a message board type app geared towards students and educators related to cooking.
Different topics correspond to different 'rooms' and users can input questions for other users to answer a la stackoverflow or yahoo answers.
We will use node to launch/listen and express to streamline the server process.
Database will be used to store questions and user data as well as for authentication of administrators.
All CRUD operations will be viable(making a post, editing a post, deleting your post, seeing other users questions)
The new technology is TBD.
We are keeping the folder structure of the boilerplate given, so the MVC paradigm will be preserved.
Authentication will be done serverside via administrator accounts and checking user-id against data saved to the questions.
Users have their own account page and can direct message other users.
